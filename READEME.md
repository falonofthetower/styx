Object Oriented Styx
====================

This is the project for week 2 of Tealeaf Academy's Introduction to Ruby and Web Development.
The project is currently in the second phase (Tic Tac Toe). I redid the first portion mainly because moving onto the second round of development I didn't like how it extended. If you simply want to play it run index.rb.

If you are intending on playtesting it you can crack open index.rb and adjust the ``end until user.wins >=`` lines to however many you want.

It is implementing more or less an MVC pattern mostly because I felt comfortable in it. I wanted to test myself by building it before reading/watching the content and feel pleased with my ability to tinker with the code in this setup.

Any comments, suggestions, or criticism is welcome.

The man with the cards is coming...
